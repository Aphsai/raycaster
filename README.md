# raytracer

A simple c++ raytracer (DOOM/Wolfenstein) style

I still need to clean up the code a bit, but the map generation and raycasting all works. 
I also kind of wanted to add textures and maybe the ability to make your own lightsources but this all comes after code cleanup :)
I'll probably post a little blurb about how the math works as well.

Here's what it looks like:

![Picture 1](img/picture_1.png?raw=true "Picture 1")
![Picture 2](img/picture_2.png?raw=true "Picture 2")
